# Project State & Handoff

> Update this file at every meaningful checkpoint. It is the first file to read when resuming after a chat/session interruption.

## Identity

- Product: Salon Booking
- Repository: https://github.com/pooya16pg-spec/salon-booking
- Product owner: salon owner (friend of Pooya)
- Engineering / creator credit: **Pooya**
- Default branch: `main`
- Deployment target: Cloudflare Workers + Static Assets + D1
- Current release: 0.1.0

## Current checkpoint

- Phase: **R00 — Foundation**
- Status: Initial scaffold and first visual pass committed to main; automated CI build is pending.
- Last code commit: ce4fc3e11fdf87c106a722cc66da81466085b45e.
- Last verified commit: none yet; CI has not completed successfully.
- Production deployment: not configured.
- Production database: not provisioned.
- Real client data: must not be entered until security and launch gates pass.

## Decisions made

1. Keep the product focused on appointment booking and salon-owner scheduling.
2. Do not build a complex multi-tenant SaaS or marketplace.
3. Client booking requires no account in the first release.
4. Owner dashboard requires protected authentication.
5. Availability and double-booking prevention must be enforced server-side.
6. Persian RTL and Jalali dates are core requirements.
7. GitHub is the source of truth; Cloudflare is the runtime/hosting layer.
8. Use a free service tier initially, while respecting quotas and provider terms.
9. Public-facing salon branding remains configurable; Pooya's creator credit stays subtle in the footer and project documentation.
10. Never commit passwords, API tokens, D1 production data or private customer details.

## Known unknowns — do not invent

- Final salon/brand name.
- Whether the business is a barbershop, women's salon or unisex studio.
- City, address, map link and contact phone.
- Service names, prices and durations.
- Opening hours, breaks, holidays and booking horizon.
- Cancellation policy and whether owner approval is required.
- Salon-approved photography and logo.
- Owner's preferred login/contact method.

Use clearly marked placeholders until the owner supplies these details.

## Verification log

| Date | Checkpoint | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-03 | Repository discovery | Empty repository confirmed; default branch `main` |
| 2026-11-03 | Bootstrap | React/Vite app, Worker entry, initial D1 schema, docs and CI workflow committed to `main` |
| 2026-11-03 | First CI attempt | Failed before dependency install because setup-node npm cache expected a lockfile; workflow corrected |
| 2026-11-03 | Current CI | Latest run pending; build result not yet verified |

## Current blockers / owner actions

- [ ] None required for initial code scaffold.
- [ ] Before production: salon content and schedule must be supplied.
- [ ] Before production: repository owner must connect Cloudflare and provision D1.

## Next actions

1. Finish CI verification and fix any real build/type errors.
2. Refine public landing page and brand system; keep sample services/prices clearly provisional.
3. Implement real service and availability API backed by D1 migrations.
4. Build protected owner dashboard.
5. Test, harden and document.
6. Deploy only after Cloudflare account/database setup and owner acceptance.

## Resume instructions for the next assistant/session

1. Read `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and this file.
2. Inspect the latest commit and current `main` tree.
3. Inspect open issues/PRs and CI/deployment status if available.
4. Run or inspect the project's actual checks; never claim tests were run if they were not.
5. Continue from the first incomplete roadmap item.
6. Update this file and roadmap at the end of the session.
